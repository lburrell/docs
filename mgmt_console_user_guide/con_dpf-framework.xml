  <p>DPF Framework Just as the metadata framework manages the tagging of data items throughout the
   lifetime of data in the system, the PHEMI Central DPF framework manages DPF deployment and
   execution. The DPF framework is very simple and easy for programmers to learn and use: code
   libraries are uploaded into the system as simple ZIP files; PHEMI Central manages DPF execution
   across all datasets and data elements.</p>
