 <title>Data Sources</title>

 <conbody>
  <p>A <b>Semios Sensors</b> data source is created and configured with a category of <b>Semios</b>.
   Its Institutional Owner and Source owner are set to the <b>admin</b> user. The privacy officer
   for the data source is set to the <b>priv</b> user. The document format is <b>Binary</b> and the
   data source retention rule is <b>Do not delete</b>.</p>
    <ul id="ul_xl2_kd3_fq">
      <li><b>When new data arrives</b>: When data is ingested, the DPF is run immediately</li>
      <li><b>Manually</b>: When data is ingested, the DPF is not run until the user manually runs
        the DPF. This is done by hitting the “Execute” button on the Data Processing Function tab of
        the Datasource page.</li>
      <li><b>Periodic</b>: The DPF is run on a periodic basis as specified by the periodic value,
        regardless if data has been ingested or not; the DPF processes ingested data starting at the
        first incompleted file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The trigger setting for the Semios data processing function is set to *Periodic for 5
      Minutes*. This means that when Semios data is ingested, derived data will not necessarily be
      generated immediately, but generated in 5 minute intervals.</p>
