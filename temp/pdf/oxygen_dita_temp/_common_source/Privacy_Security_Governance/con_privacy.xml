          their authorizations to access data. Data is tagged with attributes that describe what its
          visibility should be. These two attributes are used in access policies that are applied to
          data collections and datasets to enforce rightful access privileges. For example, a data
          analyst with CONFIDENTIAL authorization might be able to export fully identified data, an
          analyst with RESEARCHER authorization might only have access to de-identified data. </p>

          attributed-based approach to privacy is also especially helpful when not all uses or
          access requirements for data are understood up-front, or when new types of data are
          frequently introduced into the system  (both common scenarios in health care, for
          example). </p>
