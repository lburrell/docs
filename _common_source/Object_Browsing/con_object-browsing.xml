 <title>The Object Browser</title>
 <shortdesc>View or delete objects stored in <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> using the
   <wintitle>Object Browser</wintitle>.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The Object Browser lets you view individual objects that have been stored in PHEMI Central. You
      can see the metadata that has been applied to the object, the data elements (if any) that have
      been derived by running a DPF on the data, and the binary data that makes up the object, shown
      as hexadecimal with an ASCII interpretation.</p>
    <p>The Object Browser is the only access to data that a <ph conkeyref="role-vars/admin"/> has in
        <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>, and only a <ph conkeyref="role-vars/admin"/>
      can access the Object Browser. As with all other kinds of queries to the system, access to
      data is constrained by the governance placed around the data.</p>
