 <title>The Object Browser</title>
 <shortdesc>View or delete objects stored in <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> using the
   <wintitle>Object Browser</wintitle>.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The Object Browser lets you view individual objects that have been stored in PHEMI Central. You
   can see the metadata that has been applied to the object, the data elements (if any) that were
   derived by running a DPF on the ingested data, and the binary data that makes up the object,
   shown as hexadecimal and ASCII.</p>
    <p>Only a <ph conkeyref="product-vars/admin"/> can access the Object Browser, but administrator
      access to data is restricted by the governance placed around the data. Like all other data,
      access to data is governed by data visibility, user authorization, and whatever access policy
      has been applied to the data source.  </p>
