 <shortdesc>PHEMI Central uses organization-specific retention rules to manage digital assets
  throughout their entire life cycle, from data creation through curation, usage, and end of
  life.</shortdesc>

  <ul id="ul_jg4_lkc_3r">
   <li>Expiry dates are set for the data sharing agreement. Each data collection is configured with
    a data sharing agreement, which can be uploaded into <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"
    />. Configuring the data sharing agreement includes optionally setting a start and end date. If
    the end date expires, users trying to access data receive a warning and <ph
     conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> prevents them from accessing the system. The data
    itself remains in the system, but users are unable to access it unless the expiry date for the
    data sharing agreement is reset.</li>
   <li>Expiry dates are set for datasets. Each dataset is made available for a period of time set by
    the <ph conkeyref="role-vars/admin"/>. When this period expires, the dataset is flagged as
    expired and users are not able to execute the dataset. The original data remains in the system,
    but users are unable to access it unless the expiry date for the dataset is reset.</li>
   <li>
    <p>Retention rules are specified for data collections. Each data collection is configured with
     retention rules. From the retention rules together with the ingestion timestamp, <ph
      conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> calculates a time to live for every raw and derived
     data element. When the time to live expires, <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> purges
     data from the data store.</p>
