  <p>PHEMI Central uses organization-specific retention rules to manage digital assets throughout
   their entire life cycle, from data creation through curation, usage, and end-oflife. Retention
   rules are captured in the Data Management and Governance Console, and the system calculates a
   time to time for every data element based on the retention policy and the time of ingestion. It
   also prevents users from deleting data during a configured retention period and automatically
   de-identify, delete or otherwise process information when the retention period expires.</p>
