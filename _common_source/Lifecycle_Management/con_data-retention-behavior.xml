 <title>Data Retention Behavior</title>
 <shortdesc/>
 <conbody>
  <p>Each data collection has a data policy that specifies, among other things, how long data items
   should be retained in the system. When the item's "time to live" expires, <ph
    conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> deletes the item from the data store. The data retention
   behavior, which is set in system configuration, specifies when <ph
    conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> checks the data store to see what data, if any, is
   expired and should be deleted from the data store.</p>
  <p>You can configure <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> to check on a schedule, or you
   can manually initiate checking. </p>
