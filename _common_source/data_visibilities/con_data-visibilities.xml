  <p><?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>All data stored in PHEMI
   Central is protected with Visibilities, which are user-defined labels that specify the
   sensitivity of data. For example, PII (Personally Identifiable Information) is a common label,
   that can be applied to data about an individual to indicate its sensitivity, such as a Name.
   Another example, is NonPII (Non-PII) labels, such as an individuals weight or eye colour.

  <p>PHEMI Central enables the creation of custom Data Visibilities to meet an organization's needs
   around data protection through its Management Console. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>When a Data Policy is defined for a Data Source, it can be configured with any number of
   Visibilities so that the data is stored with these labels attached to the data. Additionally,
   Data Processing Functions can apply Visibilities at a fine-grained level, enabling cell-level
   data protection.</p>

  <p>You can define additional data visibilities to suit your organization's needs. Possible
   examples are CONFIDENTIAL to identify data that is sensitive and requires a user to a certain
   level of access or certification to access, PII to identify Personally Identifiable Information,
   PHI to identify personal health information, or SECRET to identify especially sensitive
   material.</p>
  <note>Once defined, a data visibility may be neither edited nor deleted.</note>
  <p>The data visibilities specified for a data source are referred to in access policies and
   matched against user authorizations to determine what actions, if any, a given user is allowed to
   perform on the data. </p>
  <p>Any data visibility defined in the system can be used by a Data Processing Function (DPF) to
   tag data elements, or cells, derived by the DPF. For example, the Social Security Number
   extracted from a health record can be tagged CONFIDENTIAL if that data visibility has been
   defined in the system. This mechanism provides "cell-level" privacy protection.</p>
