    <title>Initial Configuration Workflow</title>
    <shortdesc>Since some configuration tasks must be completed before others can be performed, <ph
            conkeyref="product-vars/admin"/>s can use this workflow to configure <ph
            conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>.</shortdesc>

        <steps>
            <stepsection>In these first steps, order matters. You cannot create users until you have
                defined user authorizations. Likewise, you cannot create access policies without
                defining both user authorizations and data visibilities.</stepsection>
            <step>
                <cmd>Log on to the <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>
                    <ph conkeyref="product-vars/gui-name"/>.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Define user authorizations.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Create users. Create at least one <ph conkeyref="product-vars/admin"/>, at
                    least one privacy officer, and at least one data analyst.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Define data visibilities.</cmd>
            </step>
            <stepsection>Data categories must be added before you can define data sources. Access
                policies are optional for data source configuration. If you are using a Data
                Processing Function (DPF) to create derived data from raw data, you upload the DPF
                archive as part of data source configuration.</stepsection>
            <step>
                <cmd>Add data categories.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Create access policies.</cmd>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Define data sources.</cmd>
            </step>
            <stepsection>In general, it is the data analyst, not the <ph
                    conkeyref="product-vars/admin"/>, who builds and executes datasets. However,
                configuring dataset destinations is part of system configuration.</stepsection>
            <step>
                <cmd>Configure dataset destinations.</cmd>
