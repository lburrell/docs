   intended use for a given dataset may be different from the intended use of the original data
   collections. In particular, the governance and controls intended for the data in a dataset may
   differ from the governance of the original data collections. In , you can attach an access policy
   to a dataset that is different from, and independent of, the access rules applied to the
   consistuent data collections.</p>

   authorizations. A given user&apos;s actual view into the data in an executed dataset is always
   mediated by the Policy Enforcement Engine, and is therefore restricted by  data visibility and
   user authorization, as experssed in an access policy. Thus, two users with different
   authorizations might execute the same dataset but end up with different views of the data.</p>
