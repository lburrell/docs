 <title>Data Aggregations</title>
 <shortdesc/>
 <conbody>
  <p>PHEMI Central supports aggregations over multiple contiguous readings from the same sensor and
   use them to compute the following derived values:</p>
  <ul id="ul_kvv_bf3_fq">
   <li>number of data points in the aggregation (count)</li>
   <li>minimum reading</li>
   <li>maximum reading</li>
   <li>sum of readings</li>
   <li>sum of squares for the readings</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The aggregations are currently computed on a hourly, daily, monthly and yearly basis, per
   sensor. Several separate aggregations are computed for each type of sensor, depending on the
   specific sensor.</p>
  <p>Wherever PHEMI Central returns an aggregated value (e.g., average hourly temperature), the
   number of data points used to calculate the aggregated value is also provided. The Semios web
   application can use this count to determine how many data points were not received by the Semios
   aggregator, fetching replacement data from an external web service if necessary.</p>
  <p>The sum and the sum of squares for the readings are used to calculate the mean and the standard
   deviation. </p>
