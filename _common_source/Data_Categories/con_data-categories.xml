 <title>Data Categories</title>
 <shortdesc>High-level data categories help you classify the data that will be stored in <ph
   conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Each data category can include multiple data sources, systems, or collections. For example, an
      organization might have a category BILLING, which could include data from several different
      billing systems in the organization. Another might have a category GENOMICS, which might
      contain genomic data submitted from different research organizations.</p>
