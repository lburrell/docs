  <p>Data Immutability PHEMI Central stores all data in a write-only data system that is never
   modified. Data may only be deleted at when its predetermined “time to live” expires, as specified
   by the organization’s retention policy. This approach provides assurance of data integrity for
   audit and compliance requirements.</p>
