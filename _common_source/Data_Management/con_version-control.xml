  <p>Version Control PHEMI Central has robust version control and rollback capabilities to ensure
   data is never lost, corrupted, or overwritten. The system keeps a history of data revisions and
   allows administrators to trace changes over time, including the ability to audit who made changes
   and when, and the ability to roll back changes if necessary. This design provides a complete
   history for audit and compliance requirements. For example, if your organization develops a DPF
   and discovers that it has been operating incorrectly, you can revert the data back to the
   original state without having to revert the DPF (which might impede development).</p>
