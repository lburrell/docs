  <p>Powerful Metadata Framework The power and sophistication of PHEMI Central’s data management
   capability arises from its powerful metadata framework, which extends from end to end across the
   system. Metadata is applied on ingestion and enriched by cataloging, indexing, and invoking data
   processing functions. The result is data description at the element level embedding the rules and
   policies governing the element, as well as configured properties such as the data collection
   ownership, retention time (time to live), and what visibility the element should have. For
   example, de-identification, encryption, and masking, along with other privacy restrictions can be
   enforced per data item, at the cell level. In a traditional system, a user would have to plan a
   file-system hierarchy or a database schema. Data would be forced to comply with this rigid
   hierarchy, and everyone just has to hope that the design scales and that requirements do not
   change. When PHEMI Central’s metadata framework is deployed with its scalable distributed
   key-value store (based on Accumulo), users no longer need worry about how to structure the
   system. PHEMI Central structures data automatically, on the fly. Data scales to large volumes at
   minimal cost while still providing fast access, and changes to requirements do not necessitate
   changes to design of the data store.</p>
  <p>Users and integrated applications benefit from the metadata because they can use simple
   web-service calls based on the properties of the data, rather than having to navigate complex
   directories or schemas to find the data they seek.</p>
  <p>Governance Rule Enforcement Most organizations have governance rules and data sharing
   agreements that stipulate how data may be used and shared. Governance rules are instantiated in
   PHEMI Central through configuration, using the PHEMI Central Data Management and Governance
   Console. PHEMI Central manages and enforces data sharing agreements by flagging the sensitivity
   of individual digital assets, tracking the retention period, recording rules around version
   control, and specifying de-identification, encryption, and data access permissions. Automating
   this function at scale across a variety of data collections and types is critical to managing
   privacy, security, and governance.</p>
  <p>Flexible, Attribute-Based Access Policies: Decoupling Data Protection from Data Use PHEMI
   Central can automatically de-identify, encrypt, or mask personal information and enforce privacy
   based on sophisticated user access privileges and fine-grained sharing and consent rules. PHEMI
   Central stores the fully identified data but strictly controls the rightful use of all digital
   assets. When the user’s access privileges and the recorded data sharing agreements dictate, PHEMI
   Central can invoke a data processing function to de-identify or anonymize any information
   information. Anonymization and deidentification may include disallowing access to personally
   identifiable information, masking certain information, redacting content, or may involve more
   sophisticated data dependency algorithms to reduce the risk of reidentification. Centralizing
   anonymization and de-identification helps reduce data sprawl and reduces the risk of data
   consistency errors.</p>
