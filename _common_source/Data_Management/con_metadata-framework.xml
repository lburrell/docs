 <title>Metadata Framework</title>
 <shortdesc>The power and sophistication of <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>’s data
  management capability arises from its powerful metadata framework, which extends across the
  system.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Metadata is applied on ingestion and enriched by cataloging, indexing, and invoking Data
   Processing Functions. The result is data description at the element level that embeds the rules
   and policies governing the element, as well as configured properties such as the data collection
   ownership, retention time (time to live), and what visibility the element should have. This means
   that de-identification, encryption, and masking, and other privacy restrictions can be enforced
   per data item, at the cell level. </p>
  <p><ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>’s metadata framework, with its flexible distributed
   key-value store, means that system designers do not have to worry how to structure the system.<ph
    conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> structures data automatically, on the fly. Data scales
   to large volumes while still providing fast access, and changes to requirements do not
   necessitate changes to design of the data store. Users and integrated applications benefit from
   the metadata because they can use simple queries based on the properties of the data, rather than
   having to navigate complex directories or schemas to find the data they seek.</p>
