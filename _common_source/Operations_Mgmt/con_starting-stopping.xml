 <conbody>
  <p>From a cold state, the components of <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> must be
      started in order. From a running system, <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>
      components are stopped in essentially the reverse order to that in which they were
      started.</p>
