 <title>Roles and Responsibilities in Deployment</title>
 <shortdesc>This section specifies who does what in the deployment use case.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>These will be a series of tables for each chapter. "Role and Responsibilities in X" The table
   summarizes who is responsible for what.  That way, the IT Admin can get the answers to two
   questions: "What am I responsible for?" and "Who's going to do X?"</p>
  <p>So something like two columns: Task and Role.</p>
  <p>So we should probably work to mention only two roles: IT Admin and PHEMI Professional Services.
   I'm expecting we'll end up mentioning some tasks that involve the DB administrator, but to keep
   the cognitive space clean it might be possible to sweep these under the rug a little. </p>
