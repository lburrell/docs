 <title>Your Deployment</title>
 <shortdesc></shortdesc>
 <conbody>
    <p>Your <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> system is installed by <ph
        conkeyref="role-vars/prof-services"/>. The <ph conkeyref="role-vars/prof-services"/> team
      will:</p>
    <ul id="ul_cvm_bp4_4r">
      <li>Set up your base system of cluster nodes</li>
      <li>Perform initial configuration of the system components and initialize them</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The system consists includes a number of components:</p>
    <ul id="ul_y24_lp4_4r">
      <li>The Hadoop ecosystem, including YARN and Accumulo</li>
      <li>Ambari, a web-based console for provisioning, managing, and monitoring the cluster</li>
      <li>MongoDB, a high availability, scalable document database</li>
      <li>Tornado, the Python-based framework on which the <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"
        /> web application runs</li>
      <li>Nginx, used as a web proxy server by <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A number of <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> components are implemented as Docker
      containers. <ph conkeyref="role-vars/prof-services"/> will install Docker as part of system
      installation. </p>
    <p>The <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> platforms can support multiple data contexts,
      called "tenants." <ph conkeyref="role-vars/prof-services"/> will have installed some number of
      tenants for your deployment.  These tenants need to be included in system administration.</p>
