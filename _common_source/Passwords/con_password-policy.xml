 <title>The Password Policy</title>
 <shortdesc>A good password policy is one way your organization can secure your information
  systems.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>A password policy generally enforces the strength of a password, by requiring passwords to be
   of a certain length and by stipulating that a password must include a certain mix of letters,
   numbers, and/or special characters. The password policy may also control how quickly a given
   password can be reused.</p>
  <p>The password policy is generally decided on by the privacy officer, or someone in a similar
   role. The privacy policy is implemented in <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> by the <ph
    conkeyref="role-vars/admin"/>, as part of system configuration.</p>
