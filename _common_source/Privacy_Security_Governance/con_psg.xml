  <p>Protect information and ensure rightful access at scale</p>
  <p>PHEMI Central manages crucial aspects of privacy and security such as data encryption, audit
   logs, and data validation. Privacy and security are designed in from the ground up to be able to
   accurately reflect your organization’s governance policies.</p>
  <?oxy_custom_end?>
  <p>Information governance is about controlling an organization’s data. The data may be sensitive;
   or perhaps it is important that the data be absolutely accurate; or perhaps the organization must
   achieve legislative and compliance targets. Data governance includes the process and policies
   around the protection, curation, and access to data. Data governance encompasses all of privacy
   protection, data security, and data audit. PHEMI Central helps organizations achieve compliance
   objectives by providing an industry-pioneering set of capabilities to manage the privacy,
   security, and governance of data. These capabilities are fully configurable and are automatically
   enforced throughout the data lifecycle.</p>
