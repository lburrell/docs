 <shortdesc>Security is the means by which you maintain privacy and protect information
  assets.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> includes a number of security mechanisms:</p>
  <ul id="ul_syt_3lb_dr">
   <li>
    <p><b>Role Based Access Control (RBAC)</b>—User roles determine what operations a user can
     perform. For example, only users with a role of <ph conkeyref="role-vars/admin"/> can configure
     the system and construct datasets, while only users with a role of <ph
      conkeyref="role-vars/data-analyst"/> can query data and execute or export a dataset. </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p><b>Configurable Password Policy</b>—<ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> allows you to
          configure the password policy that defines how strong user passwords have to be and how
          they must be changed. </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p><b>Audit Log</b>—<ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> maintains complete a audit log
     of system and user operations. The log includes all create, modify, and delete operations, plus
     a record of all queries made to the system. The audit log file is completely tamperproof for
     all users. </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p><b>Encryption in motion</b>—<ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> assumes your system
     is deployed on a trusted network. However, you can encrypt links from data sources and to
     consuming applications and analytics tools using either Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport
     Layer Security (TLS).</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
