  assets.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p><ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> includes a number of security mechanisms:</p>
  <ul id="ul_syt_3lb_dr">
   <li>
    <p><b>Role-Based Access Control</b>—User roles determine what operations a user can perform. For
     example, only users with a role of <ph conkeyref="product-vars/admin"/> can configure the
     system, while only users with a role of <ph conkeyref="product-vars/data-analyst"/> can query
     data and execute or export a dataset. <xref
      href="../users/con_user-roles.xml#concept_users-roles">Tell me about user roles.</xref></p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p><b>Configurable Password Policy</b>—<ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> allows you to
     configure the password policy that defines how strong user passwords have to be. <xref
      href="../Passwords/con_password-policy.xml#concept_password-policies">Tell me about the
      password policy.</xref></p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p><b>Audit Log</b>—<ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> maintains complete audit logs of
     system and user operations. They include all create, modify, and delete operations, and a
     record of all queries made to the system through the <ph conkeyref="product-vars/RESTful-API"
     />. The audit log files are completely tamperproof for all users. </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p><b>Encryption in motion</b>—<ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> assumes your system
     is deployed on a trusted network. However, you can encrypt links from data sources and to
     consuming applications and analytics tools using either Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport
     Layer Security (TLS).</p>
   </li>
  </ul>
