 <shortdesc> Governance is the set of processes, roles, policies, controls, and metrics that an
  organization develops and implements around information to manage its security and privacy. </shortdesc>

  <p> Information governance is about controlling and protecting an organizationâ€™s data. The data
   may be sensitive, or perhaps it is important that the data be absolutely accurate, or perhaps the
   organization must achieve legislative and compliance targets. Data governance includes the
   process and policies around the protection, curation, and access to data and encompasses all of
   privacy protection, data security, lifecycle management, and data audit.</p>
  <p>A governance policy is a coordinated approach to protecting data and assigning privileges to
   users. To control and protect your data, your organization should have a clearly defined policy
   governing data. The governance policy will drive how the <ph conkeyref="product-vars/admin"/>
