 <conbody>
  <p>In-System Governance Enforcement Governance rules for privacy and security are enforced within
   the data warehouse, rather than at the application layer. This ensures that data custodians, not
   application developers, retain control over privacy and security. Managing privacy and security
   within the data store also greatly simplifies application development and the use of analytics
   tools.</p>
  <p>Information governance is about controlling an organizationâ€™s data. The data may be sensitive;
   or perhaps it is important that the data be absolutely accurate; or perhaps the organization must
   achieve legislative and compliance targets. Data governance includes the process and policies
   around the protection, curation, and access to data. Data governance encompasses all of privacy
   protection, data security, and data audit. PHEMI Central helps organizations achieve compliance
   objectives by providing an industry-pioneering set of capabilities to manage the privacy,
   security, and governance of data. These capabilities are fully configurable and are automatically
   enforced throughout the data lifecycle.</p>
