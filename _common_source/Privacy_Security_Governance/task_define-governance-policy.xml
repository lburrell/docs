            <step>
                <cmd>Identify the different sensitivity levels of the data you will be storing in
                        <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>. </cmd>
                <info>In <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>, these sensitivity levels are
                    called data visibilities, and are used to tag ingested data for purposes of
                    privacy and access control. Examples of  data visibilities are "CONFIDENTIAL,"
                    "SECRET," or "PII" (Personally Identifiable Information).</info>

            <step>
                <cmd>Identify what authorizations your organization assigns to different users to
                    allow them to access data. </cmd>
                <info>
                    <p>Your user authorizations should reflect the actual permissions your personnel
                        are granted to interact with data of different visibility. </p>
                </info>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Specify the allowed combinations of user authorizations and data
                    visibilities.</cmd>
                <info>For example, a user with C_LEVEL authorization (perhaps a CEO, CIO, COO, or
                    CTO) might be permitted to access CONFIDENTIAL data, a user with RESEARCH
                    authorization might only be permitted to access only DE-IDENTIFIED data, and a
                    user with DOCTOR authorization might be allowed to see data of all sensitivity.
                    In <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>, the allowed access combinations
                    are implemented as access policies.</info>
