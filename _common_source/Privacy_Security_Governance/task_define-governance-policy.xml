    <title>Define a Governance Policy</title>
    <shortdesc>Make sure your organization's governance policy is defined before you begin
        configuration.</shortdesc>
    <taskbody>
        <context>
            <p>Your governance policies will drive how you configure PHEMI Central. Therefore,
                before configuring PHEMI Central, you should make sure you have your organization's
                governance policy available to you. If you are uncertain as to the appropriate data
                visibilities, user authorizations, or access policies to define for your
                organization, consult with your Information Officer, Privacy Officer, or with
                someone in a comparable role.</p>
            <p>To define your organization's governance policy:</p>
        </context>
        <steps>
            <step>
                <cmd>Identify the different sensitivity levels of the data you will be storing in
                    PHEMI Central. </cmd>
                <info>In PHEMI Central, these sensitivity levels are called data visibilities, and
                    are used to tag ingested data for purposes of privacy and access control.
                    Examples of data visibilities are "CONFIDENTIAL," "SECRET," or "PII" (Personally
                    Identifiable Information).</info>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Identify what authorizations your organization assigns to different users to
                    allow them to access data. </cmd>
                <info>
                    <p>Your user authorizations should reflect the actual permissions your personnel
                        are granted to interact with data of different visibility. </p>
                </info>
            </step>
            <step>
                <cmd>Specify the allowed combinations of user authorizations and data
                    visibilities.</cmd>
                <info>For example, a user with C_LEVEL authorization (perhaps a CEO, CIO, COO, or
                    CTO) might be permitted to access CONFIDENTIAL data, a user with RESEARCH
                    authorization might only be permitted to access only DE-IDENTIFIED data, and a
                    user with DOCTOR authorization might be allowed to see data of all sensitivity.
                    In PHEMI Central, the allowed access combinations are implemented as access
                    policies.</info>
