 <title>Governance Policies</title>
 <shortdesc/>
 <conbody>
        <p>Information governance is about controlling an organizationâ€™s data. The data may be
            sensitive; or perhaps it is important that the data be absolutely accurate; or perhaps
            the organization must achieve legislative and compliance targets. Data governance
            includes the process and policies around the protection, curation, and access to data
            and encompasses all of privacy protection, data security, and data audit.</p>
        <p><ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> enforces governance policies for privacy and
            security within the data warehouse, rather than at the application layer. In-system
            governance ensures that data custodians, not application developers, retain control over
            privacy and security. Managing privacy and security within the data store also
            simplifies application development and the use of analytics tools.</p>
        <p>Your governance policies will drive how you configure <ph
                conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>. Therefore, before configuring <ph
                conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>, you should make sure you have your
            organization's governance policy available to you. If you are uncertain as to the
            appropriate data visibilities, user authorizations, or access policies to define for
            your organization, consult with your Information Officer, Privacy Officer, or with
            someone in a comparable role.</p>
