 <title>Governance Policies</title>
 <shortdesc/>
 <conbody>
    <p>A governance policy is a coordinated approach to protecting data and assigning privileges to
      users.  To protect your data and the privacy of your data, your organization should have a
      clearly defined policy governing data. </p>
  <p>Your governance policies will drive how you configure <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"
      />.  Therefore, before configuring <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>, you should
      make sure you have your organization's governance policy available to you. If you are
      uncertain as to the appropriate data visibilities, user authorizations, or access policies to
      define for your organization, consult with your Information Officer, Privacy Officer, or with
      someone in a comparable role.</p>
