 <title>Responsiblities</title>
 <shortdesc>This section will provide a list of the areas of responsibbilitiy for the task list. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>It will basically list and explain the tasks, in a table. The task names and order will be
      parallel to the order of the chapters that follow. Likely each row in the table will link to
      the requisite chapter. (Sort of how the Admin Quick Start does for the Mgmt and Governance
      Console User Guide.)</p>
