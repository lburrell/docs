 <title>User Session Authentication</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>An authenticated user session needs to be created before using the interface. During this
   process, a valid user credential is required from which a user session is created as the user
   logs in successfully. A cookie that holds the session information is required to perform further
   operations, such as ingesting data, querying aggregations and logging out, etc.</p>
