  <title>Response Sizes</title>
  <conbody>
    <p>All query responses should be small enough to be buffered in memory on the client side (i.e.,
      a maximum of a few megabytes of decompressed data).</p>
    <p>This requirement can only be met if the query for multiple identifiers encompasses a
      reasonably sized result set (e.g., identifiers returned across a reasonably short time
      range).</p>
  </conbody>
