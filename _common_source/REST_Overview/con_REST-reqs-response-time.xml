 <title>Response Time</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>Unless otherwise noted, aggregated queries using a single tag will return within a 250 ms
   response time, exclusive of network latency between Semios and PHEMI Central. </p>
  <p>When multiple identifiers are queried (e.g., a set of sensor ids returned by a range query),
   the response time will be less than the total number of identifiers in the set multiplied times
   250 ms (e.g., 10 sensors in the set would give a max response time of 2.5 seconds). For best
   performance a single identifier is preferred for the query.</p>
