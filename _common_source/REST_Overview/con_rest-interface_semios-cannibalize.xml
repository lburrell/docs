 <title>The REST Interface</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>PHEMI Central provides an HTTP REST interface to support data ingest and querying. REST is an
   architecture style for designing networked applications using HTTP as its stateless,
   client-server, cache-able communications protocol. RESTful applications use HTTP requests and
   their associated methods (POST, PUT, GET, DELETE) to create, update, read, and delete data (<xref
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" format="html"
    scope="external">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer</xref>). PHEMI
   uses JSON as its data format and follows the HAL standard for JSON: for definitions see <xref
    href="http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html" format="html" scope="external"
    >http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html</xref>.</p>
  <p>Data is ingested by an HTTP POST to a specific URL, while data is queried by an HTTP GET to a
   specific URL.</p>
  <p>If an <i>incorrect</i> URL is specified, the following will occur:</p>
  <ul id="ul_jqm_2p3_fq">
   <li>If the REST operation is a GET or POST, a <b>404 Not Found</b> code is returned with a
    message stating the resource could not be found</li>
   <li>If the REST operation is something other than GET or POST (i.e., PUT or DELETE), a <b>405
     Method Not Allowed </b>code is returned with a message stating the resource method is not
    supported by the resource</li>
  </ul>
