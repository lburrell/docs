 <title>Data Policies</title>
 <shortdesc>The data policy provides several key items of information about a data source. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The data policy describes what type and format of data is expected from the data source and to
   what data category the information belongs. It also lists the users who are responsible for
   various aspects of the information.</p>
  <p>The data policy also specifies the privacy settings for the data source. It identifies how
   sensitive the data is, by listing which of the configured data visibilities applies to it.  The
   data policy also specifies which access policy (if any) will be used to enforce rightful access
   to the information. All raw data ingested from this source, as well as every item of derived
   data, will be tagged with this privacy information.</p>
  <p>The data policy is also where the organization's data sharing agreement is stored for
   reference. The data sharing agreement is a record that the information under consideration is
   allowed to reside on the PHEMI system. You upload the agreement as a document and specify the
   time period for which the agreement is valid.</p>
  <p>The data policy also records the retention rules that are specified for the information. The
   system uses the retention rules to calculate a time to live for each data item. When the time to
   live expires, the raw data and all associated derived data items are deleted from the system.</p>
  <p>If you want your information version-controlled, the data policy is the place where you enable
   version control.</p>
