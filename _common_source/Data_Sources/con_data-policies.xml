 <title>Data Policies</title>
 <shortdesc>The data policy provides several key items of information about a data source. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The data policy describes what type and format of data is expected from the data source and
   classifies it into a data category. It also lists the users who are responsible for various
   aspects of the information.</p>
  <p>The data policy also specifies the privacy settings for the data source. It specifies one of
   the configured data visibilities, which describe the sensitivity of the data. The data policy
   also specifies which access policy (if any) will be used to enforce rightful access to the
   information. All raw data ingested from this data source, as well as every item of data derived
   from processing this data source, will be tagged with the specified data visibility and access
   policy to protect privacy.</p>
  <p>The data policy is also where the organization's data sharing agreement is recorded. In this
   context, the data sharing agreement is a document that records permission for data from this data
   source to reside on the PHEMI system. You upload the agreement document and specify the time
   period for which the agreement is valid.</p>
  <p>The data policy also records the retention rules to be applied to information from this data
   source. The system uses the retention rules to calculate a time to live for each data item. When
   the time to live expires, <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> deletes the raw data and
   all associated derived data items from the data store.</p>
  <p>If you want your information to be version-controlled, the data policy is the place where you
   enable version control.</p>
