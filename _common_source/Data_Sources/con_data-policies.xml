 <title>Data Policies</title>
 <shortdesc>The data policy provides several key items of information about a data source. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The data policy describes what type and format of data is expected from the data source and to
   what data category the information belongs. It also lists the users who are responsible for
   various aspects of the information.</p>
  <p>The data policy also specifies the privacy settings for the data source. It specifies one of
   the configured data visibilities, which describes the sensitivity of the data. The data policy
   also specifies which access policy (if any) will be used to enforce rightful access to the
   information. All raw data ingested from this source, as well as every item of derived data, will
   be tagged with the specified data visibility and access policy, to protect its privacy.</p>
  <p>The data policy is also where the organization's data sharing agreement is recorded. The data
   sharing agreement should certify that the information under consideration is allowed to reside on
   the PHEMI system. You upload the agreement as a document and specify the time period for which
   the agreement is valid.</p>
  <p>The data policy also records the retention rules to be applied to information from this data
   source. The system uses the retention rules to calculate a time to live for each data item. When
   the time to live expires, <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> deleted the raw data and
   all associated derived data items from the data store.</p>
  <p>If you want your information version-controlled, the data policy is the place where you enable
   version control.</p>
