    datasets.</xref></p>
  <p>Datasets can be consumed by querying them through the PHEMI <ph
        conkeyref="product-vars/RESTful-API"/> or by configuring a dataset export target as a
      "destination" in the <ph conkeyref="product-vars/gui-name"/>. </p>
  <p>Dataset destinations are configured by the <ph conkeyref="role-vars/admin"/>. The destination
      is characterized in terms of the connection type, the network parameters, the destination
      database and schema names, and the user credentials for logging on to the destination. </p>
