 <title><ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> Overview</title>
 <conbody>
    <p>
      <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> draws on the Hadoop ecosystem for linear scale and
      reliable distributed data storage across large clusters of commodity servers. In contrast to
      conventional Hadoop-based systems, though, <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> is a
      fully integrated enterprise-grade data management system. At the same time, in contrast to
      traditional data warehouses, <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> can handle any
      volume, variety, and velocity of data.</p>
