 <shortdesc>User management allows you to say who can use the system to do what, and who can access
        what data.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
        <p><ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> user management is organized around user
            roles and user authorizations. Your user role defines what parts of the <ph
                conkeyref="product-vars/gui-name"/> you can use, and user authorizations are
            combined with data visibilities in access policies to specify how users are allowed to
            interact with data.</p>
        <p>Most user information is set and modified on the <wintitle>Manage Users</wintitle> page.
