 <conbody>
        <p><ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> user management is organized around user
            roles and user authorizations. Your user role defines what parts of the <ph
                conkeyref="product-vars/gui-name"/> you can use, and your user authorization
            together with data visibilities, are used in access policies that specify how user with
            your access authorizations are allowed to interact with data.</p>
