 <shortdesc>User management allows you to say who can use the system to do what, and who can access
        what data.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
        <p><ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> user management is organized around user
            roles and user authorizations. Your user role defines what parts of the <ph
                conkeyref="product-vars/gui-name"/> and <ph conkeyref="product-vars/RESTful-API"/>
            you can use, and your user authorization together with data visibilities, are used in
            access policies that specify how user with your access authorizations are allowed to
            interact with data.</p>
        <p>User information is set and modified on the <wintitle>Manage Users</wintitle> page.
