 <title>User Authorizations</title>
 <conbody>
    <p conref="../_Glossary/con_glossary.xml#concept_glossary/user-authorizations"/>
    <p>Authorizations are used in access policies together with data visibilities that have been
      applied to data sources. The access policy matches the authorization against the data
      visibility to determine what action, if any, a user may take with respect to the data. </p>
    <p>Some examples of possible user authorizations are as follows: </p>
    <ul id="ul_lsz_53w_kq">
      <li><keyword>C_LEVEL</keyword>: The user is a C-Level individual (for example, CEO, COO, CIO,
        or CTO) with a privileged level of access. Individuals with <keyword>C_LEVEL</keyword>
        authorization, for example, might be permitted to read data with
          <keyword>CONFIDENTIAL</keyword> visibility.</li>
      <li><keyword>DOCTOR</keyword>: A user with <keyword>DOCTOR</keyword> authorization might, for
        example, be permitted to read any information, including personally identifiable information
        or personal health information.</li>
      <li><keyword>ANALYST</keyword>: A user with <keyword>ANALYST</keyword> information might be
        restricted to accessing de-identified or nonidentified data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A user can be assigned multiple authorizations. User authorizations are set by the <ph
        conkeyref="product-vars/admin"/> during system configuration. </p>
    <note>Once defined, a user authorization label may be neither edited nor deleted. The
      description may be subsequently edited.</note>
