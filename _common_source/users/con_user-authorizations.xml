 <title>User Authorizations</title>

    <p><?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>A user authorization is a
      label, much like Data Visibilities, but applied to users of the system. For example, a user
      may have "Advanced PII Handling Certification" or "SECRET Clearance". These authorizations are
      different than the roles a user may have in the system (e.g. a System Administrator) since
      they pertain to specific user capabilities, not system roles.<?oxy_custom_end?></p>
    <p conref="../_Glossary/con_glossary.xml#concept_glossary/user-authorizations"/>
    <p>Authorizations are used in access policies together with data visibilities that have been
      applied to data sources. The access policy matches the authorization against the data
      visibility to determine what action, if any, a user may take with respect to the data. </p>
    <p>Some examples of possible user authorizations are as follows: </p>
    <ul id="ul_lsz_53w_kq">
      <li><keyword>C_LEVEL</keyword>: The user is a C-Level individual (for example, CEO, COO, CIO,
        or CTO) with a privileged level of access. Individuals with <keyword>C_LEVEL</keyword>
        authorization, for example, might be permitted to read data with
          <keyword>CONFIDENTIAL</keyword> visibility.</li>
      <li><keyword>DOCTOR</keyword>: A user with <keyword>DOCTOR</keyword> authorization might, for
        example, be permitted to read any information, including personally identifiable information
        or personal health information.</li>
      <li><keyword>ANALYST</keyword>: A user with <keyword>ANALYST</keyword> information might be
        restricted to accessing de-identified or nonidentified data.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A user can be assigned multiple authorizations. Authorizations are defined as part of system
      configuration.</p>
    <note>Once defined, a user authorization may be neither edited nor deleted.</note>
