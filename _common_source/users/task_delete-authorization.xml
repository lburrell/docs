                    <p>Note that user configurations and access policies both depend on user
                        authorizations. The system checks for dependencies before it deletes an
                        authorization, and if one of your users or one of your access policies
                        refers to the authorization you want to delete, the system will warn you,
                        listing the user(s) and access policy or policies that you need to modify.
                        In this case, the <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> button will be unavailable
                        (greyed out). You must eliminate all dependencies before the system will
                        permit you to delete the authorization. When all dependencies have been
                        eliminated, the <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol> button will become available. </p>
