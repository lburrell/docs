 <title>Using ETL Tools</title>
 <shortdesc/>
 <conbody>
  <p>Some data collections (for example, some databases) are not able to submit data directly to <ph
        conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>. For such systems, extract, transform, and load
      (ETL) tools can be used to extract data from the source system and then use either REST-based
      ingest or bulk ingest, depending on the requirements.</p>
