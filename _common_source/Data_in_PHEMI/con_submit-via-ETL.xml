 <title>Using ETL Tools</title>

  <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>
  <p>For data collections that can not submit data to PHEMI Central (such as a database), ETL tools are
   used to extract data from the source system and then use either the event based ingest method or
   bulk ingestion method, depending on the client's requirements.</p>
  <p>A Source Connection defines the technology/system that is the source of data, such as a
   production database system that collects data. A manual option is available for selecting data to
   be stored under this collection as well. Additionally, if the external source system is able to
   publish data, then it can be pointed at PHEMI's REST API to submit data for the data collection
   programmatically.</p>
