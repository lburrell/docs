 <title>Submitting Data to <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/></title>
 <shortdesc>Data can be submitted to PHEMI using a REST API, using FTP or SSH batch ingestion, or
  using ETL tools.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Data can be ingested and aggregated from multiple disparate sources, bringing together and
   consolidating data silos. Data can be imported in a variety of ways:</p>
  <ul id="ul_o1m_wjn_cr">
   <li><b>Streaming</b>—Machine-to-machine data collections, such as telemetry and hospital bedside
    monitors, can stream data to <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> by means of the PHEMI
     <ph conkeyref="product-vars/RESTful-API"/>.</li>
   <li>
    <p><b>Push</b>—Data collections and extract, transform, and load (ETL) tools can publish to <ph
      conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> using either JDBC or the PHEMI <ph
      conkeyref="product-vars/RESTful-API"/>. </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p><b>Pull</b>—Custom connectors based on the PHEMI <ph conkeyref="product-vars/RESTful-API"/>
     can be deployed to allow <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> to fetch data from
     sources. </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p><b>Manually</b>—Files can be manually uploaded to <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>
     from a standard browser window. </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p><b>Store by Reference and Action</b>—<ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> can
     reference remote data or a remote dataset through a URL, stored procedure, SQL query, external
     table, or the <ph conkeyref="product-vars/RESTful-API"/>. Applications can also be stored and
     executed, causing external tables or external data to be accessed and pre-processed. </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p/>
