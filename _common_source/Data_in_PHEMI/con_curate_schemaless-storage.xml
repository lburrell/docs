 <title>Schemaless Storage</title>
 <shortdesc><ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> is a key-value store that's graph-based and
  schemaless. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>In a traditional system, data is designed into a file system hierarchy or a database schema. So
   long as the schema or file system is deployed, data must comply with it. If the design does not
   scale or the requirements change, migration can be complex and costly. </p>
  <p>Unlike schema-based data stores, data in <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>'s store is
   distributed and based on key-value pairings.  Data is stored in a binary format that is
   unaffected by any schema in source or destination systems. Schemaless storage can offer benefits
   in several situations:</p>
  <ul id="ul_wpn_xwn_cr">
   <li>If the schema of the source or destination system changes</li>
   <li>If the characteristics of your data change</li>
   <li>If the requirements of a user or an application change</li>
   <li>If a new, disparate data source needs to be brought online</li>
  </ul>
