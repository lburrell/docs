 <title>Data Dictionary</title>
 <shortdesc>A data dictionary cleanses data by identifying and saving a common interpretation of
  these types or fields.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Disparate data collections may have fields that occur in common but are named differently or
   use different format conventions. For example, one data collection might have a field called
   "Sex" with values "M" and "F," while another might have a field called "Gender" with values
   "Male" and "Female." Similarly, different medical imaging systems use different terminology and
   conventions for the same concepts and measurements. </p>
  <p>You can develop a DPF for your data that acts as a data dictionary, to standardize and cleanse
   data. Cleansing data with a data dictionary greatly simplifies query and analysis. </p>
