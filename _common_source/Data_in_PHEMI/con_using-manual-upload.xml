 <title>Using Manual Ingest</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>You can use the <ph conkeyref="product-vars/gui-name"/> to manually ingest data objects into
        <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>. </p>
  <p>Manual upload is a good method when you have very large amounts of data such that HTTP/REST is
      not suitable (for example, gigabytes or terabytes of data), and/or data that needs to be
      ingested relatively infrequently. </p>
