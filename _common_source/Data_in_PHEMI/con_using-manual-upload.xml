 <title>Using Manual Upload</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>You can use the <ph conkeyref="product-vars/gui-name"/> to manually upload data objects into
    <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>. <xref
    href="../Data_Sources/task_manually-ingest-data.xml">How do I use manual upload?</xref></p>
  <p>Manual upload is a good method when you have very large amounts of data (for example, gigabytes
   or terabytes, such that HTTP/REST is not suitable) that needs to be ingested relatively
   infrequently. </p>
