 <conbody>
  <p><ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> automatically indexes and catalogs all ingested
   data. The tagged, cataloged, and indexed raw data object is the simplest type of digital asset. </p>
  <p>User-defined DPFs enable deeper and more sophisticated indexing and cataloging, while
   second-order indexes and graph relationships allow data analysts to quickly find and build
   datasets across digital assets. Linking datasets with common keys makes it possible to build
   meaningful datasets across disparate data collections, turning the data lake into a set of
   findable, searchable, easy-to-query, and analytics-ready digital assets.</p>
