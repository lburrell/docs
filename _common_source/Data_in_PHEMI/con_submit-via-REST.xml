 <title>Using the <ph conkeyref="product-vars/RESTful-API"/></title>
 <shortdesc>If the data source is able to publish data, the system can be programmed to publish to
   <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> using the PHEMI <ph
   conkeyref="product-vars/RESTful-API"/>.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>In REST-based ingestion, the client (that is, the data source or submitting system) sends an
   HTTP or HTTPS POST request. The POST request contains valid user credentials in JSON format in
   the payload body. </p>
  <p>When the credentials are authenticated, <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> returns the
      session ID and URI for the session, as well as a session cookie. Once the session is
      established, the client can POST data to the appropriate data collection by referencing the
      data collection ID .</p>
  <p><ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> listens for REST queries on port 80 (for HTTP) and
   port 443 (for HTTPS).</p>
  <p>REST-based ingestion is useful in situations where a system submits smaller pieces of data very
   frequently. Since <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> always listens on the port, the
   client system can be set up with a scheduled task to submit the data as often as needed.</p>
