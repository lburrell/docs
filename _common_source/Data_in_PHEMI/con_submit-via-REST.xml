 <title>Using REST</title>
 <conbody>
  <p>In REST-based ingestion, the client (that is, the submitting system) initiates an HTTP or HTTPS
   session with a series of REST requests. <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> listens for
   REST queries on port 80 (for HTTP) and port 443 (for HTTPS). Once the session is established, the
   client can POST data to the appropriate data source by including the data source ID returned as a
   token by <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>.</p>
  <p>REST-based ingestion is useful in situations where a system submits smaller pieces of data very
   frequently. Since <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> always listens on the port, the
   client system can be set up with a scheduled task to submit the data as often as needed.</p>
