 <title>Using Bulk Ingestion</title>

  <p>The second method currently supported is via our batch ingest method which is extremely fast.
   Secure FTP or an ssh connection is configured to enable a source system to write data to a
   temporary landing space in PHEMI Central. Currently, this temporary data file is a Sequence file
   which is a specific distributed file format, which the file transfer process must support --
   either through use of PHEMI's helper functions &amp; scripts, or client developed. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>A bulk ingest process is then triggered (schedule or remotely) which launches a Map-Reduce job
   that inserts the bulk data into PHEMI Central at a very fast rate. The temporary files are then
   purged from the system.</p>
