 <title>Using Bulk Ingest</title>
 <shortdesc/>
 <conbody>
  <p>Batch ingest of data is extremely fast. You configure a secure FTP or an SSH connection to
      allow a system to write data to a temporary landing space within <ph
        conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>. <ph conkeyref="role-vars/prof-services"/> will help
      you get this set up.</p>
  <p>You can trigger the bulk ingest process remotely or you can use a scheduled task such as a
    <keyword>cron</keyword> job. Triggering the process launches a MapReduce job that inserts the
   bulk data into <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> at a very fast rate. The temporary
   files are then purged from the system.</p>
