 <title>Data Linking</title>
 <shortdesc>The indexing, cataloging, and graph relationships <ph
   conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> generates allow you to make connections, or links, among
  data items. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Data linking allows you to connect disparate data and data that might have been isolated in
      silos. For example, imagine you ingest a patient history from a family doctor, a scan of
      prescription information from a pharmacy, Medical Resonance Images (MRIs) from a hospital, and
      X-ray images from a medical laboratory. If data elements are tagged with appropriate metadata,
      you can link all this disparate data (for example, with a patient ID number) for use in
      various ways.</p>
  <p>Graph-based data linking means that you can query and analyze a more complete picture of your
   data so that you can see, at scale and efficiently, relationships between objects in the system. </p>
