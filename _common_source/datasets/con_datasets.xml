  <p>A dataset is a specific view of data in the PHEMI system that is accessible to some limited set
   of users. The view can be across multiple data sources.</p>
  <p>Data sets are typically created for a research or exploratory data use falling outside the
   bounds of governance and controls protecting the source data. A dataset often consists of a
   subset of the fields produced by the Data Processing Function (DPF) that parses and processes the
   raw data. Access for fields within the dataset may vary, depending on the data visibilities
   applied to the original data source and those applied by the DPF.</p>
  <p>Each dataset must be associated with an access policy, to ensure that all access complies with
   the governance applicable to the data.</p>
  <p> You can define any number of datasets. Defining a dataset has no impact on configuration for
   data sources or protections to data. </p>
