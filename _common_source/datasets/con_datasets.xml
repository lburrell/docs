 <shortdesc/>
 <conbody>
  <p>A dataset is a specific view of data in <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> that is
   accessible toa given set of users. The users working with the dataset must have a role of <ph
    conkeyref="product-vars/data-analyst"/>. The view provided by the dataset can be across multiple
  data collections.</p>
  <p>Any data elements from any data collection may be included in a dataset. Defining a dataset does
   not modify configuration for data collections or impact protections to data. </p>
  <p>Datasets are typically created for research or exploratory data use, and the intended use for
   datasets may differ from the intended use of an individual data collection. In particular, the
   governance and controls required for a dataset may differ from those specified its constituent
   data collections. For this reason, you can attach an access policy to a dataset that is independent
   of the access policies attached to the consistuent data collections.</p>
  <p>Once a dataset is built by a <ph conkeyref="product-vars/admin"/>, it can be executed by users
   with a role of <ph conkeyref="product-vars/data-analyst"/>. A single dataset can be executed by
   multiple users--even by users with different authorizations. A given user's actual view into the
   data in an executed dataset is restricted by his or her authorization. Thus, two users with
   different authorizations might execute the same dataset but end up with a different set of
   data.</p>
