 <title>Datasets</title>
 <shortdesc>A dataset is a specific view of data in <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> that
  is accessible toa given set of users.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Datasets are virtual constructs, created by selecting data elements from across all of the
   digital assets data collections stored in <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>.  You can
   contsruct dataset using any available data elements, across multiple and disparate data
   collections.  They can be created in advance or on demand, and they can be altered whenever
   circumstances demand. You don't have to predefine the data, and you don't have to navigate a
   complex database schema.  </p>
  <p> To be able to define a dataset, a user must have a role of <ph conkeyref="product-vars/admin"
   />. To be able to execute or export a dataset, a user must have a role of <ph
    conkeyref="product-vars/data-analyst"/>. </p>
  <p>Datasets are instantiated only when they are executed. Datasets can be be executed directly by
   users and downloaded or exported to spreadsheets, applications, or analytics tools.  It is not
   necessary to predefine the data needed or to navigate a complex database schema.  Because all
   data is indexed and cataloged in advance, dataset execution is fast.</p>
  <p>Defining a dataset does not modify any configuration for data collections or impact any
   protections to data, because the <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> Policy Enforcement
   Engine mediates all requests for data. Users can only access and export data based on data
   visibility tags, user authorizations, and access policies, so access to data remains
   governance-compliant at all times.  </p>
  <p>Datasets are often created for research or exploratory data use. As such, the intended use for
   a given dataset may be different from the intended use of the original data collections. In
   particular, the governance and controls intended for the data in a dataset may differ from the
   governance of the original data collections. In <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>, you
   can attach an access policy to a dataset that is different from, and independent of, the access
   rules applied to the consistuent data collections.</p>
  <p>Similarly, a single dataset can be executed by multiple usersâ€”even by users with different
   authorizations. A given user's actual view into the data in an executed dataset is always
   mediated by the Policy Enforcement Engine, and is therefore restricted by the data visibility and
   the user authorizations, as experssed in an access policy. Thus, two users with different
   authorizations might execute the same dataset but end up with a different view of data.</p>
