 <title>Datasets</title>
 <shortdesc/>
 <conbody>
  <p>A dataset is a specific view of data in <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> that is
   accessible to some limited set of users. The view provided by the dataset can be across multiple
   data sources.</p>
  <p>The data elements available for building a dataset includes the derived data elements from all
   data sources across the data stored in <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>. You build a
   dataset by selecting data elements from among all those available. You can define any number of
   datasets from the fields available within <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/>. Defining a
   dataset does not impact configuration for data sources or protections to data. </p>
  <p>Datasets are typically created for research or exploratory data use, and the intended use for
   datasets may differ from the intended use of an individual data source. In particular, the
   governance and controls required for a dataset may differ from those specified its constituent
   data sources. For this reason, you can attach an access policy to a dataset independent of the
   access policies attached to the consistuent data sources.</p>
  <p>Once a dataset is built, it can be executed by multiple users--even by users with different
   authorizations. A given user's actual view into the data in an executed dataset is restricted by
   his or her authorization. Thus, two users with different authorizations might execute the same
   dataset but end up with a different set of data.</p>
  <note> Datasets are defined (built) by the <ph conkeyref="product-vars/admin"/>. However, only
   users with a role of Data Analyst are permitted to execute datasets and download/export
   datasets.</note>
