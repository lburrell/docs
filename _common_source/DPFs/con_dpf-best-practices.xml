  <title>Data Processing Functions</title>
  <shortdesc/>
  <conbody>
    <p>Data Processing Functions (DPFs) are instructions for parsing a document (e.g. a sensor log
      message) into digital assets such as a temperature reading. DPFs are discussed in more detail
      in another document. </p>
    <p>The PHEMI-developed DPFs read and process Semios sensor log messages to produce digital
      assets that support Semios use cases. The DPFs perform additional calculations to facilitate
      efficient retrieval of data assets at scale by aggregating sensor readings.</p>
    <p>To improve efficiency for many small files, it is preferred that DPFs process many ingested
      files before terminating. DPFs can be configured to run in different ways:</p>
    <ul id="ul_r34_q23_fq">
      <li><u>When new data arrives</u>: When data is ingested, the DPF is run immediately.</li>
      <li><u>Manually</u>: When data is ingested, the DPF is not run until the user manually runs
        the DPF. This is done by hitting the “Execute” button on the Data Processing Function tab of
        the Datasource page.</li>
      <li><u>Periodic</u>: The DPF is run on a periodic basis as specified by the periodic value,
        regardless if data has been ingested or not; the DPF processes ingested data starting at the
        first incompleted file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> </p>
    <p>The trigger setting for the Semios data processing function is set to *Periodic for 5
      Minutes*. This means that when Semios data is ingested, derived data will not necessarily be
      generated immediately, but generated in 5 minute intervals.</p>
