 <title>Excel Workbook DPF</title>
 <shortdesc>The Excel Workbook DPF takes an Excel workbook file and transforms it into derived
  data.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>The Excel workbook is uploaded and transformed into a single JSON document. The JSON document
   is parsed into JSON objects, each representing one data record (row) of the Excel workbook. The
   resulting set of JSON objects is stored in <ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> as a set
   of raw data. </p>
  <p>The Excel DPF supports <keyword>.xlsx</keyword> and <keyword>.xlsm</keyword> file types. The
   Excel file must be comply with the expected format, where: </p>
  <ul id="ul_uhs_dbt_gr">
   <li>Row 1 specifies the column names. </li>
   <li>Row 2 specifies the data type information for the data in the corresponding column. </li>
   <li>Row 3 specifies the data visibilities for the data in the corresponding column, as
    comma-separated list. The visibilities must be configured in <ph
     conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> or an error will occur and no data will be ingested. </li>
   <li>Rows 4 to <i>n</i> contain the data to be ingested.</li>
