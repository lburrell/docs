 <title>VCF DPF</title>
 <shortdesc>The VCF DPF processes a VCF file.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
    <p conref="../_glossary/con_glossary.xml#concept_glossary/vcf"/>
  <p>Because a VCF data file is typically so large (on the order of gigabytes), a VCF file is always
   parsed into records while the file is being ingested. If you monitor ingestion of a VCF file
   (using the <uicontrol>Task Monitoring</uicontrol> pane of the <uicontrol>System
    Metrics</uicontrol>), you will always see the <keyword>ingest</keyword> task chained to the
    <keyword>derive</keyword> task for VCF files.</p>
  <p>Once the ingestion process finishes, the file that was uploaded to the distributed file system
   is removed.</p>
