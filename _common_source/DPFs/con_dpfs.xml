  <p>A DPF is associated with a data collection as part of data collection configuration. To associate
   the DPF with the data collection you upload the DPF archive on the data collection configuration
   page.</p>
  <p><ph conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> includes a library of helper functions to simplify
   DPF development. DPFs can be developed in either Java or Python, or <ph
    conkeyref="product-vars/product-name"/> can be extended to support DPF development in any modern
   programming language that runs on a Linux OS. No MapReduce or YARN knowledge is  necessary. Your
   DPF can be written by PHEMI, by your organizationâ€™s in-house programmers, or by third-party
   developers. Training in DPF development is also available from PHEMI.</p>
